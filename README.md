## About The Project

This is my first Angular project where I used databinding and typescript. The website is a yoga and meditation site where they organize events and show schedules. It also includes prices and a validated contact form.

## Built in

1. Angular
2. HTML5
3. CSS
4. Typescript


## What I learned

This topic is very close to me, so I was happy to develop this site. I also learned a lot about how Angular and databinding work. Responsiveness was also important to me, and I always tried to make it look good on all platforms.
I love this kind of projects, from which I can learn a lot.
